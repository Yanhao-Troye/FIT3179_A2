              <p>A unicorn means a privately owned startup valued at over $1 billion. 
                 The term "unicorn" has been widely used to refer to startups in technology, 
                 mobile technology, and information technology.
                 Now, I'm going to show you some information about unicorns and hopefully 
                 provide you some insight into future investments and business.</p>

            <h2> The distribution of the unicorn companies all over the world</h2>
            <p> As of March 30, 2022, there were over 1000 unicorns in the world. 
              More than half of the unicorns on the list are based in the United States. Another 180 unicorns are in China.
              India ranks third in the international Unicorn rankings, followed by the United Kingdom and Germany. 
              Unicorns are now found on every continent, but a glance at the map shows that their populations are relatively small in Latin America and Africa.

            <h2>The countries with the top 5 unicorn companies and their industry flows</h2>
            <p> By the distribution of unicorn industries across major countries, 
              you can determine whether there are opportunities based on the characteristics of the region and the distribution of industries. 
              As we can see USA and China dominate in terms of the diversity of industries. 
              Most U.S. unicorns are concentrated in Internet Software and Fintech, 
              indicating a strong focus on digital technology and financial innovation. 
              Meanwhile, China's unicorns are more evenly distributed across various sectors, including E-commerce, Data Management etc, 
              reflecting the country's balanced approach toward technological and industrial advancement. 
              Other countries, like India and the UK, show industry specialization but at a smaller scale.

            <h2>Unicorn company industry valuation </h2>
            <p>It is also important to understand the valuation of each industry, with higher estimates indicating better prospects for growth, 
              but also facing greater competition, such as information technology and fintech. Some other industries, 
              although the valuation of unicorn companies is less, but there may be more opportunities, of course, this is not absolute, 
              we have to consider different industries according to the social situation and regional advantages.
